from Maria's email to Joe: 

Assumptions: The top part of the T intersection is our main direction/road
                       In order to make it more realistic we decided to code a separate light for  all the left turns. 

1 - Input: single car/single direction main road 
     Outpu: car successfully passes the intersection without wait 

2-  Input: single car/single direction secondary (crossing) road 
     Output car successfully passes the intersection without wait

3-  Input: multiple cars/multiple directions
     Output: How many cars passed through the intersection, and how much time and how many light cycles it took
